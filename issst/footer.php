						<h3>About the name</h3>
						<p>ISSST is entering its 20th successful year.  Between 1993 and 2008, the conference was known as the IEEE International Symposium on Electronics and the Environment (IEEE ISEE). In 2008, however, the scope of the conference was broadened to all industries and products while still maintaining a focus on the sustainability of information and communication technology (ICT) services. The new scope further strengthens this premier event on systems thinking in industry, government, and urban infrastructure. Accordingly, the name has been changed to International Symposium on Sustainable Systems and Technology (ISSST).</p>
