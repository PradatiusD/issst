<br>
7:30 am to noon (with possible extension later in the week)<br>
<br>
In conjunction with the <a href=""http://issst2016.net/"">ISSST Conference</a><br>
<br>
Phoenix, Arizona<br>
<br>
<h2>Background</h2>
Assessing the sustainability of one solution or policy over another is rarely a simple issue. Alternatives are often better in one aspect of sustainability, human health or ecotoxicity for example, and worse in another. Seldom does a single alternative satisfy all stakeholders. To address this need, numerous Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodologies are being used to help industry, NGOs and governmental policy-makers assess the sustainability of decisions and policies. These methodologies appear to be converging around several concepts: stakeholder engagement and value-based assessment to name two. However, with so many different concepts being discussed in different terms by different organizations, there is no apparent consensus on methodology. This leaves organizations searching for a solution having to wade through the different methodologies before they can even start to apply them.<br>
<br>
<h2>Goal</h2>
The goal of this workshop is to bring these different methods into some kind of harmonization. By identifying what is common between the methods and naming them in the same way, we hope to make all of them more acceptable to government and industry decision makers.<br>
<br>
It may be that for different types of decisions, different MDCA methods are more appropriate. In addition to sharing best practices, we hope to identify the “must have” features of different types of analyses. While a long-term goal is to create a standard methodology, it will likely take a number of years before these evolving methodologies are ready for that step.<br>
<br>
<h2>Preliminary Agenda</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Introductions</li>
	<li>Introduction to some of what is happening now
	<ul>
		<li>Traditional MCDA techniques: MAUT, AHP, Outranking – Igor Linkov</li>

		<li>Sustainable Return on Investment – John Parker</li>
		<li>Sustainability Return on Investment – Lise Laurin</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Brainstorm</li>
	<li>What are the most important criteria for a successful methodology?</li>
	<li>What is common between these methods? Can we identify common ways to talk about these things?</li>
	<li>What areas still need work?</li>
	<li>How do we communicate this beyond today?</li>

LCA will play an increasingly important role as a tool to support decision-making processes to achieve environmental sustainability. In order to realize its full potential and accelerate its progress, connections and coordination from ideation to application must take place. Working together, the three organizations are building an innovation system for LCA that engages diverse audiences and stakeholders, and has mechanisms for sharing knowledge and feeding it back into the creative process. This session will provide attendees with a full-spectrum overview of what is happening in LCA and the opportunities to learn, engage and accelerate progress."
