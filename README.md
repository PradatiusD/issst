# ISSST2016.net Website Instructions

## Design goal

The site's fundamental goal is for everyone to see their friends.  While this is a conference focused ostensibly on the environmental impacts of emerging photovolatics and discussing critical infrastructure systems, the real point of this conference (and therefore the website) is to remind everyone: It's all about the people.

## Homepage Overview

The homepage will feature:
- A photography collage grid of several students talking all the past conferences
- A key high-paced exciting highlight video, explaining the conference's purpose & goal while quickly cross-fading to all the shots of past speakers.  We could use Tom's presentation of ISSST (available at https://youtu.be/o7ltDN1doB0).  Beyond that, I would like to suggest a few editorial clips such as:
